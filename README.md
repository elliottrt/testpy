# test.py

test.py is a basic test runner. It collects a single test case or all test files in a given directory and evaluates them using the provided command, then displays this information to the user. It also provides the ability to evaluate the test cases and store their results for future testing.

# Security

test.py uses direct shell calls. It is entirely possible for a malicious command template to erase your whole filesystem. ***DO NOT USE*** for anything serious.

## Usage

`./test.py <program command> <one ore more test cases or test case directories> [options]`

## Quickstart

`./test.py sh tests`

Will run the shell scripts in tests. These call test.py on the example-tests to verify they work as expected.

## Options

### Test Case Command

The command that will be run for each test case can either be simple or complex.
If the command can be written in the form `<command> <test case file>` then simply write `<command>`.
If the command requires more complexity, write out the command and replace all references to the test file with a `@`, which will be replaced at runtime with the name of the test case file. This symbol can be changed with the `-s <symbol>` and `--symbol <symbol>` options.

Directories are, by default, recursively searched for test cases. This can be disabled with `-n` and `--no-recursion`

Information about every test case and their status is printed. This includes passing, failing, and skipped tests. Tests are skipped if their record file is missing or malformed. To only print out failing tests, use the `-f` or `--fail-only` options.

### Updating Test Cases

When run with the option `-u` or `--update`, all test cases will be evaluated and their results stored in record files for future test evaluations to check against.

The `-c` and `--create-empty` options will generate empty test case records, which may be edited to manually create test cases.

### Test Case Customization

The file extension of test cases may be specified with `-e <extension>` and `--test-ext <extension>`, or left empty, in which case all files except record files are tested.

The record file extension may be specified with `-r <extension>` and `--record-ext <extension>`, or left empty, in which case it defaults to '.rec'.

These two may not be the same, and test.py will error if they are.

### Other

* `-o` and `--no-color` options disable color printing for test case FAIL/PASS/SKIPPED messages.
* `-e` and `--echo` options print out what command is being run for each test case before it happens.
* `-T` and `--timeout` options enforces a timeout, in milliseconds, on each test case. If the test case takes longer than that duration, it fails. By default this is not enabled.
